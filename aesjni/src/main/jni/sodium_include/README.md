### you need to generate libsodium static link file for other abis.
All of file below this directory was generated.
I only put armv8-abi into there that is not enough to be a release project.You need to generate all abis static file of **libsodium** into there.  
You can delete all that, and regenerate from [libsodum](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium). 

### libsodium version
Other information what I need to remind was that the **libsodium static file** which I built was **v1.0.18**. 
That version is the last stable version up to now.
