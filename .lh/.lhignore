# list file to not track by the local-history extension. comment line starts with a '#' character
# each line describe a regular expression pattern (search for "Javascript regex")
# it will relate to the workspace directory root. for example:
# ".*\.txt" ignores any file with "txt" extension
# "/test/.*" ignores all the files under the "test" directory
# ".*/test/.*" ignores all the files under any "test" directory (even under sub-folders)
